# Chartiful

Chartiful is an organization with the intent of creating charts and graphs with a consistent API accross all modern front-end JavaScript frameworks and beyond. We currently have support for React, React Native and Vue, with plans to support Svelte, Angular, Ember and Native Script in the near future. We eventually plan to expand beyond just JavaScript frameworks and into mobile UI and mobile cross platform frameworks; we plan to provide solutions for Swift (iOS Native), Kotlin (Android Native), Flutter and any other new technologies that emerge over time.

Our project is currently small, but growing and we are hoping to expand our community as we provide support for additional frameworks and platforms.
